        <h1 class="blog">Digital image processing</h1>

        <p class="blog-item3-p">In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing
            on
            digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many
            advantages
            over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and
            can
            avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are
            defined over
            two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional
            systems.</p>

        <hr>
        <p class="blog-item3-p">Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called,
            were
            developed in the 1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
            Laboratories,
            University of Maryland, and a few other research facilities, with application to satellite imagery,
            wire-photo
            standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and photograph enhancement. The
            cost of
            processing was fairly high, however, with the computing equipment of that era.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="images/card6.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="blog-item3-p">That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated
            hardware
            became available. Images then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such as
            television
            standards conversion. As general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over the role of
            dedicated
            hardware for all but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. With the fast computers and
            signal
            processors available in the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form of image
            processing and
            generally, is used because it is not only the most versatile method, but also the cheapest.</p>

            Technology Hall of Fame in 1994.</p>
